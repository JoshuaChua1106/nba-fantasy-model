    "In Feature Engineering, we'll transform raw game stats into smart features that help predict fantasy scores. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Rolling averages - Player's last 5-10 game performance\n",
    "  - Matchup data - How players perform vs specific teams/defenses\n",
    "  - Schedule factors - Rest days, back-to-back games, home/away\n",
    "  - Recent form - Is the player trending up or down?\n",
    "  - Opponent strength - Defensive rankings and pace of play\n",
    "\n",
    "  The goal is to give our model the same context fantasy experts use - like knowing LeBron scores less on\n",
    "  back-to-backs or Steph shoots better at home. These features capture patterns beyond basic box scores."
